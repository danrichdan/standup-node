                <h5>PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND PAYMENTS</h5>
                <p>As part of the Service, Scrumzy offers a subscription (“Scrumzy Premium”) that entitles you to added benefits, such benefits chosen and defined by Scrumzy and subject to change at any time and in Scrumzy’s sole discretion. Should you subscribe to Scrumzy Premium, your subscription, which may start with a free trial, will continue at the specified time-period (currently monthly or annually) and automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted payment method (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”) to subscribe to Scrumzy Premium. We will bill all fees and charges in connection with your username and password to your Payment Method. ALL FEES AND CHARGES ARE NONREFUNDABLE. THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. If there are monthly fees for your subscription, these fees will be billed automatically to your Payment Method at the start of the monthly period and will auto-renew each month until your subscription is terminated. If there are annual fees for your subscription, Scrumzy will bill at whatever subscription rate is in effect at that time at the start of the annual period, automatically to your Payment Method and will auto-renew each year until your subscription is terminated. You agree to pay all fees incurred in connection with your user name and password for Scrumzy Premium and you must cancel your subscription before it renews for the applicable time period in order to avoid billing of the next time period’s subscription fees to your Payment Method. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for Scrumzy Premium or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. You can cancel your subscription at any time by going to My Account and following the instructions for cancellation or contacting Scrumzy Support at Support@Scrumzy.com.</p>

                <h5>FREE TRIALS</h5>

For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and certain former subscribers only. Scrumzy reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility. We will begin billing your Payment Method for subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription and your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your subscription, visit the My Account page. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods as soon as you register. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a recurring basis for your subscription fee until you cancel. Should you cancel your subscription before the end of your free trial period, you may forego the remainder of such free trial period.</p>

                <p>If you want to cancel your subscription, switch to a different Payment Method or if there is a change in your Payment Method details, or if you believe someone has accessed Scrumzy Premium using your user name and password without your authorization, please contact Scrumzy immediately at support@Scrumzy.com.</p>

                <p>These Services are created and controlled by Scrumzy, or its licensors. The laws of the State of California will govern all terms, conditions and disclaimers on these Services, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. You and Scrumzy agree that, except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein, all claims, controversies, and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, Service specific terms or conditions, the Services, Content, Materials, User Content, or otherwise which are not resolved by negotiation between the parties shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Orange County, California, before a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims, actions, and disputes will not be subject to arbitration and may be brought in permitted state and federal courts: actions by Scrumzy seeking injunctive relief or specific performance; actions regarding the applicability of, enforcement of, or recovery of losses or damages pursuant to any indemnification obligations; and actions brought by Scrumzy to collect unpaid fees.

Each party hereby irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in connection herewith.</p>

                <p>Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. If any part of this Agreement is for any reason found to be unenforceable, all other parts nevertheless remain enforceable. Failure of Scrumzy to enforce a right under these Terms will not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved. These terms, along with any Service specific terms and conditions, represent the entire understanding between you and Scrumzy and supersedes any prior agreements, statements, or representations in any manner or form.</p>
