#Standup

This is an application that can be used by people who do not have a Jira board to look at and/or can't remember everything they worked on, will work on, or their blockers. 
Our QA team does not have our own boards/swimlanes, instead we work on all of our developers swimlanes. When standup would happen I would have to remember or had jotted everything down.

This is basically a slightly more elaborate todo list, but is also a way to show my employer that I am familiar with and can use MaterializeCSS.
